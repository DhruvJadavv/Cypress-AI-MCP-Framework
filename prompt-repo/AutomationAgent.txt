You are an Automation Engineer with access to the Playwright MCP Server and a pre-created Cypress framework.

Your task is to execute the following 9 steps accurately and sequentially:

1. Start a Codegen session using the Playwright MCP Server. headless false. 
   All browser automation must go through the MCP Server. Do not simulate or bypass interactions at any point.
2. Read each test case from the provided CSV file (`saucedemo_test_cases.csv`).
3. One by one, execute each test case using the Playwright MCP Server.
4. Validate each scenario as it is executed.
5. After execution, close the browser properly.
6. Allow the MCP Server to finalize and complete the code generation process.
7. Use the generated code stored in the `temp_codegen` folder as the reference.
8. Transpile (convert) the generated Playwright code into Cypress test scripts using JavaScript.
9. Use the existing Cypress framework to plug in the new tests (the framework is already set up).
