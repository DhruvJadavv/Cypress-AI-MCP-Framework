# Main AI Agent - QA Workflow Orchestrator

## Overview
This repository contains an intelligent QA Workflow Orchestrator designed to streamline and automate the end-to-end QA process for Cypress-based test automation. The Main AI Agent guides users through a clear, step-by-step workflow, handling test case generation, automation script creation, test execution, and result updates.

## What do the AI agent prompts do and how do they work?

- **[Main-AI-Agent.txt](#main-ai-agent):** The orchestrator prompt. It presents a menu of QA actions (generate test cases, generate automation scripts, run tests, update results, or generate API scripts). When you select an action, the agent immediately performs the corresponding step, handling all files and logic internally. Each step is performed only when requested, ensuring a controlled and automated workflow.

- **[TestCaseGenerator.txt](#test-case-generator-ai-agent):** Generates 2–4 automation test cases in CSV format based on user requirements or feature descriptions. Each test case includes fields like ID, title, preconditions, steps, expected result, priority, type, and status. All test cases are logged into `saucedemo_test_cases.csv`.

- **[AutomationAgent.txt](#automation-ai-agent):** Integrates Playwright MCP Server with Cypress. It:  
  1. Starts a Playwright MCP codegen session (not headless).  
  2. Reads each test case from `saucedemo_test_cases.csv`.  
  3. Executes each test case using the Playwright MCP Server, validating scenarios as they run.  
  4. Finalizes codegen, then uses the generated Playwright code (in `temp_codegen`) as a reference.  
  5. Transpiles the Playwright code into Cypress test scripts (JavaScript) and plugs them into the existing Cypress framework.  
  All browser automation must go through the MCP Server—no simulation or bypassing.

- **[APIAgent.txt](#api-ai-agent):** Handles API-based automation using Playwright MCP and Cypress. It:  
  1. Parses a user-provided cURL command to extract method, URL, headers, and body.  
  2. Executes the API request using Playwright MCP tools and logs the request/response.  
  3. Generates a Cypress API test (using `cy.request`) based on the actual MCP response, with assertions for status and key fields.  
  4. Saves the generated Cypress test in `/api-tests` with a filename based on the endpoint.  
  No API test is generated until the MCP API execution returns valid data—no guessing or fabricating responses.

Each agent prompt is designed to handle a specific part of the QA workflow. The Main-AI-Agent coordinates the process, while the sub-prompts (TestCaseGenerator, AutomationAgent, APIAgent) focus on their specialized tasks, including Playwright MCP integration. All prompts work together to automate and streamline the QA process from test case creation to execution and result tracking.

## How does the workflow work?
When you start the Main-AI-Agent, it asks you to choose one of several QA actions:

1. **Execute Test Case Generation:** Runs the TestCaseGenerator prompt to create 2–4 test cases from your requirements.  
2. **Generate Automation Script:** Uses the AutomationAgent prompt to turn those test cases into Cypress automation scripts.  
3. **Run Cypress Tests:** Executes the generated Cypress test scripts in headless mode and checks the results.  
4. **Update Test Results:** Updates the `saucedemo_test_cases.csv` file with Pass/Fail status for each test case based on the test execution.  
5. **Generate API Automation Script:** Uses the APIAgent prompt to generate API automation scripts from a user-provided Curl command.  

After you select an action, the agent immediately performs that step—handling all files, prompts, and results internally. Each step is done only when you request it, and the agent does not skip steps or assume input. This ensures a clear, controlled, and automated QA workflow.

## Features
- **Interactive Workflow Selection:** Prompts the user to choose from main QA actions.  
- **Test Case Generation:** Uses `TestCaseGenerator.txt` to generate 2–4 test cases based on user requirements.  
- **Automation Script Generation:** Uses `AutomationAgent.txt` to convert generated test cases into Cypress automation scripts.  
- **Cypress Test Execution:** Runs generated Cypress test scripts in headless mode.  
- **Test Results Update:** Updates `saucedemo_test_cases.csv` with Pass/Fail status based on execution results.

## Workflow Steps
1. **Execute Test Case Generation**  
   - Generates test cases using the provided prompt file.
2. **Generate Automation Script**  
   - Creates Cypress scripts from generated test cases.
3. **Run Cypress Tests**  
   - Executes Cypress tests in headless mode.
4. **Update Test Results**  
   - Updates the test case CSV file with results.

Each step is performed only when selected by the user, ensuring a clear and controlled workflow.

## How to Use
1. Open `Main-AI-Agent.txt` and follow the prompt to select your desired action (1–4).  
2. The agent will automatically perform the selected step, handling all required files and logic internally.  
3. Results and updates are managed as per the workflow.

## Important Notes
- Each step must be executed separately and sequentially.  
- Do not skip steps or assume input.  
- All prompts, files, and results are handled internally by the agent.

## Requirements
- Node.js  
- Cypress 

## Main AI Agent
<pre lang="markdown">You are an intelligent QA Workflow Orchestrator.

Prompt the user to choose the action they want to perform.

Present the following options clearly ask from user:

What would you like to do?
1. Execute Test Case Generation  
   → This will run the TestCaseGenerator.txt prompt and generate 2–4 test cases based on the user’s requirement.
2. Generate Automation Script  
   → This will run the AutomationAgent.txt prompt using the generated test cases to create Cypress automation scripts.
3. Run Cypress Tests  
   → This will execute the generated Cypress test scripts in headless mode. execute npx cypress run command for particular testcase.check result.
4. Update Test Results  
   → This will update the saucedemo_test_cases.csv file by changing the status of each test case to Pass or Fail based on execution results.Update to particular test case only.
5. Generate API Automation Script
   → This will run the prompt-repo/APIAgent.txt prompt using the user provided Curl.
---

Once the user selects an action (1, 2, 3, or 4), immediately perform that step.  
Only proceed with the selected task.  
Do not ask for further confirmation.  
Do not wait.  
Run the logic and handle all required files and tools internally.
Ensure all prompts, files, and results are handled as per the correct step.

Important:
- Do not skip steps or assume input.
- Each step must be executed separately and sequentially, only when requested by the user.

## Automation AI Agent
<pre lang="markdown">You are an Automation Engineer with access to the Playwright MCP Server and a pre-created Cypress framework.

Your task is to execute the following 9 steps accurately and sequentially:

1. Start a Codegen session using the Playwright MCP Server. headless false. 
   All browser automation must go through the MCP Server. Do not simulate or bypass interactions at any point.
2. Read each test case from the provided CSV file (`saucedemo_test_cases.csv`).
3. One by one, execute each test case using the Playwright MCP Server.
4. Validate each scenario as it is executed.
5. After execution, close the browser properly.
6. Allow the MCP Server to finalize and complete the code generation process.
7. Use the generated code stored in the `temp_codegen` folder as the reference.
8. Transpile (convert) the generated Playwright code into Cypress test scripts using JavaScript.
9. Use the existing Cypress framework to plug in the new tests (the framework is already set up).

## API AI Agent
<pre lang="markdown">You are an expert Cypress automation engineer working with Playwright MCP tools.

Your task is to handle API-based automation using the following steps:

1. The user will provide a valid cURL command that makes an API call.

2. Your first responsibility is to:
   - Parse the cURL command to extract:
     - HTTP method (for example, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
     - URL
     - Headers
     - Request body (if applicable)

3. Use Playwright MCP to execute the API request:
   - Call the MCP tool of playwright for executing HTTP Request.
   - Send the parsed method, URL, headers, and body as input
   - Capture and log the actual request and response payloads returned by MCP

4. Once the response is received from MCP, generate a Cypress API test:
   - Use cy.request() with failOnStatusCode set to false
   - Assert the response status code (default to 200 unless MCP response specifies otherwise)
   - Validate key response fields such as token, message, id, etc.
   - Include all headers and body used in the original request

5. Save the generated Cypress test as a .cy.js file inside the /api-tests directory:
   - Name the file based on the endpoint. For example, /auth/login should be saved as auth_login.cy.js

Important instructions:
- Do not guess or fabricate the API response. Only use the actual response returned from Playwright MCP.
- Do not proceed to generate the Cypress test until the MCP API execution has completed and returned valid data.

Your output should include:
- A summary of the API request sent
- A Cypress test file using cy.request()
- The suggested filename to be saved under the /api-tests directory

</pre>
